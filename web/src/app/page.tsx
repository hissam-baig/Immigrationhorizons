/**
 * Section order follows the journey in the content strategy: landing →

 * proof → questions → conversion. Background tones alternate so no two
 * adjacent sections read as a single block.

 * Not yet present: the "Latest Articles" section. It depends on the blog
 * data layer, which is ported in Phase 6 — stubbing it now would mean
 * shipping fake posts.
