  definition:
    "Evidence packaging is the review, organisation, and indexing of a petition's supporting documents into a structured exhibit set. Well-organised evidence lets an adjudicator locate the proof behind each claim without searching; poorly organised evidence, however strong, can be overlooked simply because it could not be found.",

        "Evidence packaging is the work of turning a pile of supporting documents into a structured, indexed exhibit set that an adjudicator can navigate. It sits between having the right evidence and filing a petition that presents it well — and it is routinely underestimated.",
        "The core idea is simple: every factual claim the petition makes should be traceable to a specific, numbered exhibit, and the adjudicator should be able to get from the claim to the proof in seconds. When the petition letter says a method was adopted by other research groups, the reader should be able to turn immediately to the exhibit that shows it.",
        "This is not clerical work. Deciding what to include and what to leave out, how to group and sequence exhibits, and how to label them so the argument is easy to follow, is a substantive part of building a persuasive petition. A strong record presented as an unsorted stack is a weaker petition than a moderate record presented clearly.",

  faqs: [
    {
      question: "What is evidence packaging?",
      answer:
        "It is the review, organisation, and indexing of a petition's supporting documents into a structured exhibit set. The aim is that every claim the petition makes is traceable to a specific numbered exhibit, so an adjudicator can move from a claim to its proof immediately rather than searching an unsorted stack.",
    },
    {
      question: "Does how I organise my evidence really affect the outcome?",
      answer:
        "Yes. Adjudicators work through many petitions under time pressure and are not obliged to hunt through a disorganised set for support the petition asserts exists. Strong evidence that cannot be located can be overlooked entirely, while a clean, indexed package builds credibility before the argument is even read.",
    },
    {
      question: "Should I include every document I have?",
      answer:
        "No. More is not better. A large set with no structure is harder to credit than a smaller, well-ordered one, and marginal or duplicative documents make the strong evidence harder to see. Part of packaging well is deciding what to leave out so that what remains does real work.",
    },
    {
      question: "Can you package evidence for a petition I prepared myself?",
      answer:
        "Yes. Evidence packaging can be engaged on its own, including for a petition you or your attorney have otherwise prepared. We review the record, organise and index it, and produce a filing-ready exhibit set, whether or not we prepared any of the other documents.",
    },
    {
      question: "What is an exhibit index?",
      answer:
        "An exhibit index is a numbered list at the front of the package describing each exhibit, so the adjudicator has a map of the evidence before they enter it. Together with claim-to-exhibit references in the petition letter, it is what lets a reader move directly from an assertion to the document that supports it.",
