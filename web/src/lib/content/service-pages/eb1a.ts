        "EB-1A sits in the first preference of the employment-based immigrant categories. It is reserved for individuals who can demonstrate extraordinary ability in the sciences, arts, education, business, or athletics — defined in the regulation as a level of expertise indicating that the person is one of that small percentage who have risen to the very top of the field of endeavour.",
        "Two features make it attractive. First, it is a self-petition: like the EB-2 NIW, no employer needs to sponsor you and no labor certification is required. Second, EB-1 is a higher-preference category than EB-2, which can matter considerably for applicants from countries where the second preference is heavily oversubscribed.",
        "The trade-off is the standard of proof. EB-2 NIW asks whether your proposed endeavour is nationally important. EB-1A asks a different question entirely: whether you have already achieved sustained national or international acclaim, and whether your achievements have been recognised in your field. It is a backward-looking test about your record, not a forward-looking test about your plans.",

This is a qualitative judgement about the totality of the evidence.",
        "The practical consequence is that a petition can satisfy four or five criteria on paper and still be denied at the final merits stage. Petitions that are assembled purely to tick criteria, without a coherent argument that the record as a whole demonstrates acclaim, are precisely the ones that fail here.
