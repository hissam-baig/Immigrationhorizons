Because an employer is sponsoring you into a defined position, the evidentiary bar is lower than EB-1A's: you must show international recognition as outstanding in your academic area, rather than sustained acclaim placing you among the very top of your field. You need evidence meeting two of six criteria rather than three of ten.",

      answer:
        "EB-1B is a U.S. employment-based immigrant category for professors and researchers who are internationally recognised as outstanding in a specific academic area. It requires at least three years of teaching or research experience in that area and a qualifying job offer from a U.S. employer, who files the petition.",

      question: "Can I self-petition for EB-1B?",

        "No. Unlike EB-1A and EB-2 NIW, EB-1B requires a U.S. employer to sponsor you and to file Form I-140 on your behalf. If you do not have an employer sponsor, EB-1A or EB-2 NIW are the self-petition alternatives worth assessing.",
    },
    {
      question: "How many EB-1B criteria do I need to meet?",
      answer:
        "At least two of the six criteria set out in 8 CFR 204.5(i)(3)(i). Meeting two is a threshold rather than a conclusion — USCIS then assesses whether the record as a whole establishes that you are internationally recognised as outstanding in your academic area.",
    },
    {
      question: "Does a postdoctoral position qualify as the job offer?",
      answer:
        "It depends on the nature of the position. The qualifying offer must be a tenured or tenure-track teaching position, or a comparable research position, and comparable research positions are generally expected to be permanent rather than for a defined term. Where a postdoc is being used, the permanence of the role needs to be addressed directly in the petition.",
    },
    {
      question: "Can a private company sponsor an EB-1B?",
      answer:
        "Yes, for a comparable research position, provided the employer employs at least three full-time researchers and has documented accomplishments in the academic field. Both conditions require evidence supplied by the employer, which is a part of the case that is often prepared late.",
    },
    {
      question: "What is the difference between EB-1A and EB-1B?",
      answer:
        "EB-1A is a self-petition requiring sustained national or international acclaim, evidenced against three of ten criteria. EB-1B requires an employer sponsor and a qualifying position, but applies a lower standard — international recognition as outstanding in a specific academic area, evidenced against two of six criteria.",

    {
      question: "Does the three years of experience have to be after my PhD?",
      answer:
        "Not necessarily. Experience gained while working on an advanced degree can count where the applicant had full responsibility for the classes taught, or where the research conducted is recognised as outstanding. How that experience is documented matters, and it should be addressed explicitly in the petition.",

      question: "Can you work with my university's HR or faculty affairs office?",
